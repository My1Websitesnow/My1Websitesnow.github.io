      <p>Summer Landsdown is Ranger Operator Series Yellow, otherwise known as Ranger Yellow, of the Ranger Operators in Power Rangers RPM. Her operation number is three.</p>
      <p>Retroactively, she is also referred to as the RPM Yellow Ranger or Yellow RPM Ranger, though these are in reference to the show as opposed to proper labels.</p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p> Summer did not start off kind or caring, as she once was a rich and spoiled heiress who seemed not to care about anyone but herself. She lived in a luxurious mansion, where her personal butler was frequently subjected to her mistreatment. Her parents were hardly ever around to take care of her, and she was surrounded by equally spoiled, self-centered friends. </p>
      <h3>Escape to Corinth</h3>
      <p> When Venjix forces attacked on her birthday, she was abandoned by her friends and staff during the evacuation, her friends literally throwing her from the transport.</p>
      <p> While wandering aimlessly in search of help, she was found by Andrews, who took it upon himself to escort Summer to Corinth. Along the way, Summer began to gain a better understanding and appreciation for what Andrews had done for her all these years, and slowly began to return his kindness. When they were about 20 miles from Corinth, they were ambushed by Grinders, and Andrews was killed protecting her, forcing her to completely abandon her selfish personality to live up to the example he set.</p>
      <p> Summer somehow managed to make it the rest of the way to Corinth City, where she reunited with her parents. As the shields were prepared to be raised, she got wind of a report that a fighter pilot had crashed outside of the city. She subsequently took a medical uniform and motorcycle and left to save the pilot despite her parents' objections. She found a downed Scott Truman and helped him return to Corinth before the city's shielding went up, making her rescue of Scott her first significant act of goodwill.</p>

      <h3>Get in Gear</h3>
      <p>After making it into the city of Corinth, Summer was recruited by Doctor K. Summer now serves as Ranger Yellow. She pilots the Bear Crawler.</p>
      <p>When Corinth's shields were raised, Summer asked her parents to allow her to fend for herself. Her parents agreed on the condition that she would get married in a year. When her parents later showed up to have that promise kept, Summer had no desire to. Unfortunately, she soon learned her parents were no longer rich, as their assets had been lost during the Venjix takeover, and was forced to uphold her promise in order for her parents to regain their wealth. Summer ended up not marrying, however, as the ceremony was interrupted when Tenaya 7 came in to try and steal the Landsdown treasure, a Black Diamond. Summer and the rest of the Rangers eventually fended them off. Even though the diamond was lost, Summer's parents finally came to terms with Summer's decision to continue her life as a Power Ranger.</p>
      <p>When Dillon and Ziggy arrived in Corinth and were subsequently jailed, it was Summer who first considered Dillon a suitable operator for the Series Black tech, willing to trust him while others would not. While the primary colored Rangers together were able to convince him to join, Summer's words in particular were later instrumental to prevent him from abandoning his duties.</p>
      <p>It is revealed that Summer is attracted to both Scott and Dillon. While in the burning Venjix factory, Summer and Dillon almost share a kiss until water falls on them. They then almost kiss again before Gem &#38; Gemma interrupt. Gemma noted in her diary that Summer is totally caring, especially when it comes to Dillon.</p>
      <p>After Venjix is defeated for the last time, Summer leaves Corinth with Tenaya and Dillon to help rebuild the ravaged world.</p>
      <h3>Clash of the Red Rangers</h3>
      <p>Summer and the other RPM Rangers use the SkyRev Megazord to face off against Professor Cog. The RPM Rangers quickly fire. However, Professor Cog protects himself with a hidden shield, and knocks down the Megazord with his own gun. When he leaves for the Samurai Rangers' dimension, only Scott pursues him. Later on, all of the Samurai Rangers apart from Jayden are transported to the RPM world. Summer, along with the other RPM Rangers help the Samurai Rangers return to their own world. </p>
      <h3>Megaforce</h3>
      <p>Summer along with the other Ranger Operators and other Ranger teams are seen in Troy's premonition about the Legendary Battle. </p>
      <p>She and the other Rangers are seen again in another of Troy's dream/vision about the Legendary Battle.</p>
      <p>After that, the Mega Rangers meet Robo Knight, Summer is seen in a flashback when Troy relates his visions about the Legendary Battle.</p>
      <h3>Super Megaforce</h3>
      <p>When the Mega Rangers receive the new Legendary Morphers, what makes the Mega Rangers access to Legendary Mode, Summer along with other Rangers are seen briefly in another vision/flashback when Gosei talk about to the Mega Rangers to take the form of the past Rangers using the Legendary Ranger Keys. </p>
      <p>Emperor Mavro was defeated, but the remaining thousands of X Borgs still stand. Tommy gathered all the existing Power Rangers, Summer returned with her fellow Ranger Operators as part of the army of Legendary Rangers led by Tommy that helped the Mega Rangers defeat the Armada once and for all, fighting in a huge battle against hundreds of X Borgs and dozens of Bruisers. After the demise of the X Borgs, Tommy shook hands with Troy and teleported off along with Summer and the Legendary Rangers. She then returns to her home dimension in the RPM World. </p>
      <h3>Beast Morphers</h3>
      <p>During his research in the Ranger archives, Devon Daniels finds information of the Ranger Operators in another dimension and sees a picture of Summer and her team with Doctor K.</p>
      <p>Upon learning Venjix has returned under his reborn alias of Evox in the dimension where the Beast Morphers live, Doctor K provides her assistance to get Nate Silva to make up for his mistakes and tells the story of her and the Ranger Operators while flashbacks of Scott, Summer and Flynn appear. </p>
      <h3>Dino Fury</h3>
      <p>Zayto activates the Legendary Ranger Database, showing Master Blue that Master Green came to them after the Dinohenge statues were destroyed and restored them to normal. Also, Zayto says that he found Ranger teams who were saved in their darkest moments through unexplained reasons and shows them three specific moments. Including the Legendary Battle where all the Legendary Rangers including Summer and the other Ranger Operators coming to the aid of the Megaforce Rangers in the Legendary Battle and helping them defeat an entire army of the Armada's X Borgs. </p>

        <p><strong>Abilities</strong></p>
        <p>Aside from perusing the Ranger arsenal for battle, Ranger Operators can also generate their own personal ability without weaponry.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Energy Blast: Summer can read energy signatures and focus the flow into concentrated surges of energy. Like the special attacks of Scott and Flynn, they drain energy levels. Her special ability only works in Ranger form.</li>
