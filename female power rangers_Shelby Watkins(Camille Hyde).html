      <h3>Dino Charge</h3>
      <p> A waitress at the Dino Bite Cafe, she stows away on one of Kendall Morgan's digs and accidentally finds the Pink Energem, bonding with the Tricera Zord. </p>
      <p>Shelby is the daughter of a corporate family, the owners and proprietors of Watkins Ice Cream. Her father, Mr. Watkins, wants her to take over the family business when he eventually steps down. Shelby started working in the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum's Dino Bite Cafe a year before the events depicted in Dino Charge. She wanted more than anything to move up in her role in the museum and be part of the fossil digs instead of serving in the restaurant.</p>
      <p>When trying to persuade Kendall Morgan, the museum director, and her two assistants Chase and Koda to allow her on a fossil dig does not work, Shelby decides to stow away on their truck for a dig hoping that it will persuade Ms. Morgan to let her take a job at the dig itself. However, before she could get their attention at the site, a hooded figure steals a crate from the collected items. Shelby chases after the unknown person and gets an assist from Tyler, a passing explorer. It turns out the crate contained an Energem and the hooded figure reveals himself to be a menacing monster named Iceage who, upon realizing Tyler also possessed an Energem, freezes the two. Contact with the Energems saves both from completely freezing and they find themselves with fossilized weapons. When Shelby and Tyler insert the Energems, they become Rangers and are able to fend off Iceage.</p>

      <p>While on their way back to the Museum, they found Riley Griffin, whose scooter broke in the middle of the journey and offered him a ride. All three of them soon discover an underground lab below the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum where they meet Keeper and learn about the Energems and their roles as Power Rangers. Although Shelby is uncertain of why the Energem choose her, Kendall convince Shelby that the team needed her knowledge on dinosaurs. She then decided to joins the team.</p>
      <p>When Shelby offered an idea to find the Energems based on their energy signature, she worked on an E-Tracer alongside Kendall. Although the E-Tracer was hacked by Wrench easily, Shelby’s relationship with Kendall improved immensely. </p>
      <p>After Sledge was thought to be destroyed and the majority of the Dino Charge Rangers returned to their normal lives, Shelby soon took business classes on the insistence of her father. </p>
      <p>However after a pep talk from Riley, Shelby stands up to her father, and reveals her own dream is to study fossils. Accepting this, Mr. Watkins apologizes and gives the team an ice cream dinosaur cake as a favor to his daughter. </p>
      <p>During her tenure as a Ranger, Shelby had a crush on Tyler Navarro where she tried to hide her true feelings for him. This resulted in situations like her pretending to be the Princess of Zandar to be around Tyler and even going on a picnic date with him. However, their relationship didn’t completely take develop until Tyler got jealous of her flirting with a member of the N-Zed Boys, Shelby’s favorite band. Trying to prove himself, Tyler tried to audition for the band only to have stage fright. Shelby then tries to help Tyler’s audition by singing a duet with him. Although they both didn’t get into the band, they recognize each other’s feelings and soon become romantically involved. </p>
      <p>When a majority of the Rangers were trapped in stone by Badussa, Shelby, using Zenowing's instructions, creates the Spino Zord and the Spino Charger. Soon after, Zenowing offers Shelby a chance to become his apprentice but she declines, wanting to study real dinosaurs instead. </p>
      <p>After the timeline was changed and the dinosaurs didn’t become extinct, Shelby becomes one of the caretakers of the new Amber Beach Dinosaur Zoo and is seen taking care of one of the Triceratops.</p>
      <h3>Beast Morphers</h3>
      <p><strong>The Evox Snare</strong></p>
      <p>In the Grid Battleforce base, when Devon Daniels ask for help from Doctor K to try to search a form of device to separate Mayor Daniels from Evox, she reveals one. A few years ago, Doctor K read about how the Dino Charge Rangers including Shelby were able to rescue Zenowing from being inside Doomwing thanks to the Split Emitters and that peaks Devon’s interest.</p>

      <div class="flex-container image-container"> <img src="female power rangers_Shelby Watkins(Camille Hyde)//Shelbyhenshin.webp" alt="shelby holding her morpher in her hand"> </div>
      <p>It's unknown why Shelby and Riley didn't come to the main dimension in order to find Keeper alongside their team, but when the Grid Battleforce Rangers left to fight a Gigadrone and the Dino Charge Rangers were preparing to fight Snide, Tyler called them to help. Just when the team defeated Snide using specials attacks, the newly revived Sledge and his crew appeared. Shelby fight against Wrench, but was defeated and almost destroyed alongside her teammates if it weren't for the Grid Battleforce Rangers appearing at the last second, blasting Sledge's crew and managing to get away after rescuing Keeper. Shelby and Riley came back to their dimension off-screen. </p>
      <p><strong>Teaming up against Evox's Army</strong></p>
      <p>Days after their previous adventure, Goldar Maximus and Snide were attacking the Dino Charge Rangers in their dimension and were after their Energems. During the battle, Shelby fight against some Triptoids, Vivix and Putty Patrollers. Four of the Grid Battleforce Rangers arrived but the villains still managed to steal four of the Energems and defeat both teams of Rangers, while Shelby and Riley retained their powers. </p>
      <p>When both teams were hiding and discussing the villains' plans of making an evil Zord, Jason and Devon arrived, gave the team Morphers and Morph-X powered Dino Chargers to the other four Dino Charge Rangers and decided to split themselves into two teams.</p>
      <p>Shelby and her team followed Jason on a frontal assault while the Beast Morphers team attacked from behind. When Goldar Maximus and the rest of Evox's army arrived, Jason summoned his old Mighty Morphin' teammates and the Dino Rangers to defeat the army in a big fight.</p>
      <p>During the battle, Shelby defeated some foot soldiers alongside Billy and Ethan.</p>
      <p>When the battle seemed won, the Legendary Dino Rangers combine all their weapons into the Dino Power Ultra Blaster and manage to destroy Goldar Maximus.</p>
      <p>Evox arrives and says that the real fight begins now. Shelby witness how Evox is using the geode to summon his newest Zord, the Chimera Zord, she and the other Dino Rangers are attacked by the evil Zord. Shelby summoned her Tricera Zord, and her team joined in forming the Dino Charge Megazord and The Legendary Dino Rangers summon their respective Zords. All three Megazords try to fight against the Chimera Zord, but it proves to be too powerful for them.</p>
      <p>Devon manages to summon the Beast-X King Zord and join in the fight. Devon and the Dino Charge Rangers combine their Zords into the Dino Charge Megazord Beast-X King Formation. With the combined might of all three Megazords, the Ranger teams combine their blasts into one powerful energy beam, destroying the Chimera Zord as Evox retreats.</p>
      <p>With the fight over, the Ranger teams regroup in the quarry, with the Dino Charge Rangers regaining their Energems and Keeper regaining his staff. Zoey is confident they can handle him before thanking everybody for their help, the teams departed and said goodbye to the Dino Charge Rangers.</p>
