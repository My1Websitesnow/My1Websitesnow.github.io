      <p>Kira Ford is the Yellow Dino Ranger of the Dino Rangers. Retroactively, she is also referred to as the Dino Thunder Yellow Ranger or Yellow Dino Thunder Ranger, though these are in reference to the show as opposed to proper labels.</p>
      <p> In Power Rangers Operation Overdrive, three years later, Kira is recruited and her powers would be completely restored by Sentinel Knight for forming part of the Retro Rangers helping the Overdrive Rangers against Thrax and his Evil Alliance.</p>
      <h3>Dino Thunder</h3>
      <p> Kira hides her pretty femininity behind a tough facade full of attitude and fire. Yet she's determined to prove she is an individual. She dresses in her own, carefully cultivated neo punk style. She's an amazing singer and plays the guitar as the front person to her own band. Kira uses her biting wit to hide her real emotions, except in her music, which reveals her passion and sensitivity. She keeps hidden the fact that she is struggling with adolescence along with everyone else. At times she can be insecure, hidden behind a "I'm a tough and don't care" attitude, but she also has a great capacity for caring about others.</p>
      <p> She is intelligent, but does not always apply herself to her schoolwork, except in creative writing, at which she excels. As a musician, Kira is best able to express herself in her music. She doesn't want anything to do with the Dino Gems at first, because it's just too weird for her, but when Dr. Oliver recruits her as the Yellow Ranger, she decides to put aside her fears. She uses the Ptera Scream to stop evil in their tracks, and pilots the powerful Pterazord. Kira learns to look beyond people's stereotypes, and realize that despite their flaws, they can be friends.</p>
      <p> A meteor crashes to Earth and makes anyone who comes into contact with it shows sides of themselves they never show, in Kira's case, she became like a Valley Girl, shopping excessively and worrying about her appearance. However, she is restored to normal later. </p>
      <p>Kira uses up the remainder of her Dino Gem energy in the final battle against Mesogog, retaining her Ptera Scream but losing all of her other powers. She later moves to New York to try and gets a recording contract and starts recording music. By 2025, Kira has become a famous singer, with Sydney Drew as one of her fans. </p>
      <h3>S.P.D.</h3>
      <p> <strong>Meeting S.P.D. Rangers</strong></p>
      <p>At her 1-year high school reunion, Kira is brought to the future by Broodwing where she and her fellow Rangers rejects Broodwing's alliance proposal, recovers their Dino Gems and escape while they are chase by several Krybots.</p>
      <p>After they destroy the Krybots, they're attacked and confronted by Broodwing, who again offers an alliance that Kira, Conner and Ethan once again rejects, until the B-Squad shows up to protect these civilians from Broodwing's attack. After Broodwing withdraws, the B-Squad introduce themselves as the Power Rangers, but the trio reveal that they're the Power Rangers.</p>
      <img src="female power rangers_Kira Ford(Emma Lahana)/kira ford1.jpg" alt="kira ford evil" class="align-right">
      <p>Kira and the other Dino Rangers are given a grand tour of the Delta Base and are introduced to Doggie and Kat. The Dino Rangers are determined to help against Broodwing, but the S.P.D. Rangers insist that it's too risky.</p>
      <p>Seeing in the screem the dificult battle that pass B-Squad against a Krybots army the Dino Rangers insist on helping, but Cruger says if anything should happen to them, this future might not exist.</p>
      <p>Despite Cruger's warning, the Dino Rangers show up anyway to help the S.P.D Rangers in the battle. Fortunately Dr. Kat, searching their Morphers in the S.P.D database and regenerated them.</p>
      <p>All nine Power Rangers morph into their Ranger forms and using their respective power ups, during the battle, Kira teams up with Z &#38; Syd to display girl power, with their blasters attacking successfully dealt with some Krybots, Blue-Head Krybots and Orange-Head Krybots. Immediately face to face with Morgana dodging her attack, making a combine attack star with Kira using a Ptera attack to Morgana and Z &#38; Syd using the Deltamax Striker against Morgana.</p>
      <p>The Dino Rangers assemble the Z-Rex Blaster and send Gruumm running. All ten of the Power Rangers come together to celebrate their victory over Gruumm.</p>
      <p>Conner, Ethan, and Kira want to stay and help out, but the S.P.D. Rangers convince them that they will go on to lead exciting and significant lives. After that, Conner, Ethan, and Kira have their memories wiped and are sent to the past in order to prevent them from knowing too much about their futures.</p>
      <p> <strong>Second encounter with S.P.D. Rangers</strong></p>
      <p> At some point in 2004 after Conner receives his Battlizer, Gruumm made his temporal trip from the wormhole. At Reefside High, Kira practiced with her guitar, while she and Trent, listening about Ethan's video game until Conner joins the conversation. When she, Trent, Ethan and Conner witness a spaceship hovering over the school.</p>
      <p>Kira and the other Dino Rangers go into the woods talking about the strange Space Ship that appears in the sky until Zeltrax with some Tyrannodrones interrupts the conversation, the four Dino Rangers prepare to fight against him. However, Kira like the other Dino Rangers witness that Gruumm's Space Ship transports Zeltrax away in the ship, walking in the woods with more questions about what happened with Zeltrax after he is transported in the Space Ship until they see another ship, later meeting Jack, Z, and Bridge. Kira listening about the mission of the S.P.D. Rangers came to defeat Emperor Gruumm, when they detected Troobian energy in Reefside, Kira and the other Dino Rangers decided to join them due to that Zeltax also joins forces with Gruumm, implying that it is also her and their fight. </p>
      <p>Meeting again with Jack and Bridge, immediately Kira and the other Rangers sees the fight with Tommy against Zeltrax. However, an army of Tyrannodrones and Krybots appear before them, led by a Vine Monster, a Green Monster and a Spotty-Eyed Monster, everyone morphed into their Ranger forms and fight against the monster army. </p>
      <p>Fortunately reinforcements meaning more Rangers like Sam, Syd, Sky, and Doggie, appear in the battle but are surrounded by Krybots and Tyrannodrones. Despite not being too many, the Rangers decide not to give up and fight.</p>
      <p>Kira attacking some Krybots using her Thundermax Saber, until she is attacked by the Spotty-Eyed Monster but she ends up dodging the attack. Kira teamed up again with Z and Syd, making a combine attack against the Spotty-Eyed Monster. After Syd gives a kick to the Spotty-Eyed Monster, Kira &#38; Z gave him a double kick. Kira, Z, and Syd use their blasters to destroy the monster.</p>
      <p>Later, she joins her team when forming the Z-Rex Blaster to help the S.P.D. Rangers and their Canine Cannon on a final blast against the army.</p>
      <p>Following their victory, Kira had her memory erased by the S.P.D. Rangers to not interfere with the timeline.</p>

      <p>Kira would be called back to action once more. The Sentinel Knight came to ask Kira for help in protecting the jewels of the Corona Aurora, after the Operation Overdrive Power Rangers were disconnected from the Morphing Grid by Rita and Zedd's son Thrax. Kira was more than happy to help, and the Sentinel Knight restored her Yellow Dino Ranger powers, albeit permanently this time.</p>
      <p>After that she, Bridge and Xander are present, and before Adam and Tori was presented. Kira attacks Mig, flying with a Ptera attack using her Ptera Grips.

      <p>After that, Kamdor and Mig decide to retreat. The Retro Rangers demorph immediately afterwards and meets the Overdrive Rangers. Before the conversation gets too deep, according to Tori and thinks perhaps another place would be better to talk.</p>
      <p>She and the others response to Will's question that everyone was a Ranger once. Kira like the other Rangers are listening the confuse history about how Bridge became a Red Ranger after first being the Green Ranger and later the Blue Ranger from the future until the unexpected appearance of the Sentinel Knight, who recounted how he restored the powers of Kira and some of the other past Rangers thus naming them the new Power Ranger team.</p>
      <p>Later, Kira and the rest of the Rangers save an ancient monument, returning to the Hartford Mansion. Kira had a brief conversation with Adam, she express that the Command Center is very incredible, mentioned that Dr. Oliver would have loved it. She listens to Adam's response that he can't believe that his old friend and teammate is a doctor, when meeting again with the Overdrive Rangers. Listening Rose's question confirms like the rest of the veteran Rangers that everyone gets along. She motivates that the Overdrive Rangers will recover their powers a little time.

Miratrix tells him not if they get there first. The Evil Alliance is no more and they vanish, after the two Ranger teams reunited and shake hands.</p>
      <p>Everyone is gathered inside the Hartford Mansion, Kira listening that how Dax was happy to see them, then upset that they were staying, and now sad that they are leaving. Kira indicated that she is working on a new CD and claims she'll visit the Hartford Mansion. Everyone is in an upbeat mood. Mr. Hartford suggests they gathered together.
