      <p>Gemma is Ranger Operator Series Silver, or simply Ranger Silver, of the Ranger Operators in Power Rangers RPM. Her operation number is eight.</p>
      <p>Retroactively, she is also referred to as the RPM Silver Ranger or Silver RPM Ranger, though these are in reference to the show as opposed to proper labels.</p>
      <p>Six years later, she returned in Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel along with other Legendary Rangers, helping the Ninja Steel Rangers against Lord Draven and his army of Robo Rangers.</p>
      <h3>Pre-Venjix</h3>
      <p> Gemma was one of the captive phenoms in 'Alphabet Soup' along with her brother, Gem. Both speak in conjoined sentences with a high level of energy. They attempted to befriend the solitary Doctor K and even gave her a birthday present, even though they knew she didn't like them. She and her brother were the original testers for the prototype Ranger gear for Project Ranger. Later on, Doctor K discovered that they were being deceived into staying in the Alphabet Soup facility, and she had tried to get them out of the facility only to face dire consequences. When Venjix gets past Alphabet Soup and seeped into the world, she and her brother help Doctor K get out of the facility. She was last seen with her brother running off to collect the classified Gold and Silver series bio-suits before a section of Alphabet Soup collapsed behind them, but an explosion seemingly destroyed them in front of Doctor K.</p>
      <h3>Return</h3>
      <p>Mysterious Gold and Silver Rangers later appeared twice to save the core Rangers from Venjix's new body. Afterward, they all returned to Corinth, it is within the city that it is confirmed that Gem and Gemma are indeed the mysterious Rangers, and the two are subsequently reunited with an excited teary-eyed Doctor K.</p>
      <h3>Defending Corinth</h3>
      <p>Their Rangers suits, being experimental at the time they were created, do not have the same properties that the other Rangers do. For instance, they cannot manipulate their biospheres like the other five, and the suits themselves have a pilot's jumpsuit design to fit their aircraft Zord design. This includes their wing-like cuffs on the suit which, unlike the wheel or gear (in the case of Green and Black) cuff design on the others, does not spin. Gemma has the series 8 Engine Cell Chip used for the Tiger Jet and Whale Zord. Though numbered '8' to match her Zord's number, she is the seventh member of the team.</p>
      <p>Before reuniting with Doctor K and meeting the Rangers, Gem and Gemma were out in the wasteland on an offensive campaign against Venjix. Because they were out on this campaign for so long, they have a "shoot first, ask questions later" type strategy, which greatly disturbs the more passive Colonel Truman, as well as earns them the nickname "The Boom Twins" by the other Rangers. This makes them trigger-happy, and they take very little time to plan, but more than make up for it with their fighting skills. The twins rarely separate from one another, and it often seems as though they share the same brain, or at least think very similarly, since they always end up finishing each other's sentences, but there have been times where they have had their own individual thoughts. At some point during their time on the run, they were forced to work in a Grinder-building factory, at which point they met a blind girl they would later learn was Dillon's sister.</p>
      <p>After the war, Gem and Gemma join Eagle Squadron, now under Scott's leadership, obviously recommended for the posting because of their experience with their aircraft Zords. They seem to be quite excited about their new posting, saying that they "get to blow things up, and get paid for it."</p>

      <h3>Clash of the Red Rangers</h3>
      <p>Gemma and the other RPM Rangers use the SkyRev Megazord to face off against Professor Cog. The RPM Rangers quickly fire. However, Professor Cog protects himself with a hidden shield, and knocks down the Megazord with his own gun. When he leaves for the Samurai Rangers' dimension, only Scott pursues him. Later on, all of the Samurai Rangers apart from Jayden are transported to the RPM world. Gemma, along with the other RPM Rangers help the Samurai Rangers return to their own world. </p>
      <h3>Megaforce</h3>
      <p>Gemma along with the other Ranger Operators and other Ranger teams are seen in Troy's premonition about the Legendary Battle.</p>
