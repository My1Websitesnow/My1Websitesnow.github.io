    <p>Officer Jennifer "Jen" Scotts is Time Force Pink and the leader of the Time Force Rangers.</p>
    <p>She is also referred to as Pink Time Force Ranger.</p>
    <h3>Time Force</h3>
    <p> In the distant future of the year 3000, Jen was an officer for the Time Force Police, which has nearly eradicated crime. The only remaining villain was a mutant named Ransik. Jen was present - as were many other Time Force operatives - when the Red Time Force Ranger, Alex, managed to arrest Ransik and take him for trial.</p>
    <p>Jen similarly attended the trial with Alex, whom she had been dating for some time and who, it is later revealed, was also the one that had helped her pass the Time Force entrance exam. When she was a rookie, she hadn't been able to handle the pressure and nearly quit until she met Alex who helped her through it. She described him as the one person she knew she could always trust. With Ransik captured, Alex proposed to Jen and she accepted his offer. Whether anything could have come from this relationship is unknown, because Jen and her team were waylaid while transporting Ransik to the Cryo Prison. Though they attempted to chase him down, they arrived just in time to see Ransik strike down Alex before escaping into the past. With his final breath, Alex charged her and her team (Lucas, Trip, and Katie) with traveling into the past and apprehending Ransik again. He gave her his Red Chrono Morpher, and informed her of four similar Chrono Morphers that they could use to become Time Force Rangers. Distraught by the apparent death of her lover, she did as he had asked and traveled to the year 2001, where she and the others were stranded in the fictional town of Silver Hills.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, as the four Time Force operatives discovered, the four Chrono Morphers would not work without the Red Chrono Morpher. They were forced to recruit Wesley Collins, a local man with a genetic resemblance to Alex, despite Jen's objections. Jen became the Pink Time Force Ranger and leader of the team.</p>
    <p>Seeing only the differences between Wes and Alex, she refused to let Wes join the team and scolds him, until Trip shares with him her tragic loss behind Jen's back. It took some time, but she was finally able to accept him for who he is. In return, Wes helped them adjust to 21st century life - by providing an abandoned Clock Tower as a place to stay, and present-day clothes. Discovering that the Clock Tower had once been home to a business ("Nick of Time Odd Jobs"), Jen decided to open the store for their keep. Wes eventually left his rich lifestyle behind for good to live with Jen and the Rangers who welcomed him with open arms. When Wes' father, Mr. Collins, discovered the identities of the Rangers, he attempted to hire them behind Wes' back as revenge, but Jen (and the others) refused his offer.</p>
    <p>Over time, Jen developed true affection for Wes. However, when Alex mysteriously returned, seemingly from the dead, and stripped Wes of the Red Time Force Ranger powers, Jen found herself asking which of them she loved more. Alex had become bitter and stern, "following the book" to the degree that he would accept no suggestions beyond his own, unlike Wes who was team-oriented and friendly. Ironically, it was the differences between Wes and Alex that made her choose Wes. When Alex's actions nearly caused them to lose to Dragontron, Lucas' rebellion brought Trip and Katie against Alex for the way he treated everyone, calling Wes the better Ranger and getting Alex to give up his Morpher to Wes. Wes immediately proves Jen right by easily destroying Dragontron when Alex had a hard time. Alex returned to the future, finally convinced that Wes was right for the job. Wes also seems to change Alex back a bit as he saves Mr. Collins, admitting that Wes changed his views. Alex is revealed to still deeply care for Jen because as soon as he hears that she's in trouble he sends Wes the Strata Cycle saying that since he's not there himself he trusts Wes to take care of Jen for him. This causes Wes to start to back off because he thinks Jen and Alex are still perfect for each other (after what Alex did he can understand what Jen saw in him) not realizing that Jen was starting to fall for him more. Wes makes sure to inform Jen of Alex's actions at a moment when she was seemingly about to admit her feelings for him.</p>
    <p>The romance between Jen and Wes would not last long after that, as a rift in time started to form over Silver Hills as Ransik prepared his final assault. In response, Wes traps Jen and the other Rangers in their own Time Ship, set to travel back to 3000.</p>
    <p>Upon arrival, Jen learns from Alex that Wes was killed in the eventual fight which devastated her. Furthermore, Jen and the other Rangers had to, by Time Force policy, have their memories of the past wiped clean. Not wanting to lose Wes, either from his death or from having her memory wiped clean, Jen chooses to return back in time to help him in battle as the other Rangers followed, while at the same time, formally ending her engagement with Alex. While heartbroken, Alex allowed them to go and instructs Jen to use the Time Force Megazord to get to the past as it has the best chance of surviving the trip, to which Jen thanks him for the advice.</p>
    <p>The Rangers return to the past in time to save Wes and help defeat Doomtron and Ransik's Cyclobot army. Jen and the other Rangers then faced Ransik himself, but were quickly defeated. Jen lured Ransik into a nearby warehouse where he blasted at what he believed to be Jen, but was actually a repentant Nadira who was protecting a human baby. As Jen watched in shock, Ransik realized the error of his ways and surrendered to the Rangers. A stunned Jen handcuffed Ransik, completing their mission. Afterwards, the Rangers were forced to return to their own time. Jen left Wes her Time Force Badge and finally told Wes she loves him which Wes sadly returned. Jen then returned to the future with the other Rangers seen off by Mr. Collins, Eric, and the Silver Guardians.</p>
    <h3>Wild Force</h3>
    <p><strong>Returned to the past</strong></p>
    <p>Jen returned to the past when she was assigned to track down the three mysterious Mut-Orgs (Rofang, Kired, and Takach), but had apparently disappeared. Her travels took her back in time to 2002, Jen now cloaked and spied on the Mut-Orgs who gathered on a rooftop, while she watched from the shadows, Jen uses a strange device to translate the strange language of the Mut-Orgs, listening to their plans that are to contaminate the Earth. Create more Orgs, and dominate the future, the Mut-Orgs listening to the device and their search to where it is. Jen is now watching the monsters from a ledge above and later leaves with the information acquired.</p>
    <p>Wes got injured enough by Rofang, but when the Mut-Org leader is about to finish him, it is stopped by some blast shots from high up. It turns out to be Jen in a cloak, armed with a special gun that can temporarily harm the Mut-Orgs. She helps Wes, Eric, and the Wild Force Rangers get away. </p>
    <p><strong>Teaming up with the Wild Force Rangers</strong></p>
    <img src="female power rangers_Jennifer 'Jen' Scotts(Erin Cahill)/jennifer 'jen' scotts1.png" alt="Jen changing clothes" class="align-right">
    <p>During her return to the past, she meets Wes again, who was upset that she was in the past for a week and did not contact him. Jen apologizes and it is clear that she and Wes are still deeply in love with each other. Jen and the other Rangers heard Circuit contacting them and says that reinforcements are on the way in the Time Ship. The rest of the Rangers meet the time ship on the beach. </p>
    <p>The Time Force Rangers have a reunion after much time until Ransik and Nadira shows up. Jen tries to confront Ransik but she is stopped by Trip. Ransik acknowledges Jen and their history and offers to help. Cole, having sensed Ransik's heart, came up to Jen and said Ransik was telling her the truth as his words came from his heart, so Jen decided to hear Ransik out.</p>
    <p>At the Animarium, she like the other Rangers realize that Ransik created the Mut-Orgs so she decided to give Ransik a chance, Jen agrees and removes his handcuffs. When the Time Force Rangers, Ransik and Nadira spend the night at the Animarium, Jen and Wes spend the night catching up. The next morning, the Rangers, Ransik, and Nadira go to the power plant and divide into groups.</p>
    <p>Alyssa and Jen fight the Putrids using Chrono Blasters against them, to give Trip time to shut down the reactor.</p>
    <p>The Mut-Orgs without their mutant powers try to run, only to be stopped by Merrick. Soon, all the Rangers gather to face the Mut-Orgs and morphed into their Ranger forms.</p>
    <p>Jen and Alyssa the Wild Force White Tiger Ranger team up against and defeat Kired with a motorized jump kick.</p>
    <p>Jen and her fellow Time Force Rangers and the Wild Force Rangers regroup with the Red Rangers with their respective Battlizers and attacking with the Chrono Blasters and Crystal Sabers destroying the Mut-Orgs.</p>
    <p>With their battle now won, the Rangers rush back to Ransik and Nadira. Jen, like the other Rangers witness Ransik's redemption and has also turned him fully human. They all return to the Animarium for a picnic, in celebration. She then returns to the future in the year 3001.</p>
