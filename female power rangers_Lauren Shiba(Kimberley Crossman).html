    <p>Lauren Shiba is Jayden Shiba's older sister and the true 18th head of the Shiba Clan. As such, she took over the role of Samurai Ranger Fire, the Red Samurai Ranger and led the team against the Nighlok, being the only one who could seal Master Xandred away.</p>
    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p> Lauren and Jayden were separated at a very young age. Lauren was sent away in an attempt to fool the Nighlok into thinking Jayden was the true head of the Shiba Clan in order to protect her as she was able to perfect the Sealing Symbol. As part of this plan, Jayden had to keep this a secret from the other Rangers. </p>

    <p> Eventually Lauren returned to the Shiba House, and Jayden decided that he had to leave and put Lauren in charge, stating "There can only be one Red Ranger", noting that the Rangers' loyalties may be divided if he stays. Lauren notes that she'd hoped Jayden would find another way and that they could all fight together, but however, she relents. Jayden's plan ultimately backfired when Antonio decided to go after him. Mike also expressed his dissent toward this change in leadership. She trains a lot and seems not to eat much, so it is no surprise that she loves to eat Mia's cooking since she doesn't have a lot to compare it to. </p>
    <p> She showed great skill during her training with the LightZord, countering all its hits with her Spin Sword. When Mike asked to train with her, he was beaten easily.</p>
    <p> After Master Xandred returned and absorbed Dayu, Lauren performed the Sealing Symbol while the other Rangers distracted Xandred to buy her time to prepare it. After Lauren was done drawing the Symbol, she used it on Xandred, only to find out that Dayu's humanity protected him from the blast.</p>
    <p> After her failure to perform the Sealing Symbol, she gave leadership back to Jayden, as well as supplying the Shiba Fire Disc to strike Xandred's weak spot. When the first doesn't work, a badly injured and weakened Lauren gave all the symbol power she had onto a second Shiba Fire Disc.</p>
    <p> After the battle, all the Power Rangers went their separate ways. Although Lauren left, she promised Jayden that they'll be seeing a lot more of each other. </p>
    <h3>Super Megaforce</h3>
    <p>Lauren was not shown to have fought in the final battle between the Legendary Rangers and the Armada. Given her Sentai counterpart fought in the Legend War, it is entirely possible that she did indeed fight elsewhere. </p>

  <h2>Ranger form</h2>

      <p><strong>Red Samurai Ranger</strong></p>
      <p> Lauren morphs using a Samuraizer (previous version) in brush mode, unlike the other Samurai Rangers. With it she morphs into her Ranger costume for close combat and ground battles. Her symbol power and Ranger form do not conflict with Jayden's Red Ranger powers and are independent.</p>
