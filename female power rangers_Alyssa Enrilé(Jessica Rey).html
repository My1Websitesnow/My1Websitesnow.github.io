      <p>Alyssa Enrilé is the White Tiger Wild Force Ranger, the White Ranger of the Wild Force Power Rangers and the second-in-command to Taylor Earhardt before Cole's arrival.</p>
      <h3>Wild Force</h3>
      <p> Alyssa is the kind, nurturing member of the group. When any Ranger is injured, she is right there tending to their wounds. Alyssa tries to diffuse any tension between team members. Being a kindhearted and beautiful young woman, Alyssa often is in the position of peacekeeper. She was the second Ranger recruited into the team, joining shortly before Max. </p>
      <p> In the early days of the team, Alyssa tries to keep peace between Cole and Taylor who would have conflicting ideas on what was best for the team. She would cook for them and even read stories to Danny and Max. When Alyssa isn't fighting Orgs, she stays active by riding her bike to school and taking dance classes at Turtle Cove University, where she has a scholarship for perfect GPA. </p>
      <p> Alyssa is trained in the martial arts–specifically in Enrilé Tiger-style–by her father, who is a renowned martial arts instructor. He intended for her to eventually take over running his school, and was heartbroken when Alyssa decided to move to Turtle Cove and attend Turtle Cove University. One day when he visited his daughter, he was proud to discover that not only was she a Ranger, but she had excelled in the martial arts he taught her. As a result, he accepted her decision to continue her education
      <p> She later helped Cole find out about his parents' death by cross-referencing his picture.</p>
      <p> She was involved when the Wild Force Rangers teamed up with the Time Force Rangers, and she battled the Putrids alongside Jen; the Pink Time Force Ranger, using the Chrono Blasters.</p>

      <p>When Master Org and all the Orgs (sans Jindrax &#38; Toxica who renounced their ways) were defeated, Alyssa was relieved of her life as a Ranger. She finished college and became a kindergarten teacher. In the last episode, she is seen telling her story to her class in a fairy tale fashion, making her the narrator of the season. </p>
      <h3>Dino Thunder</h3>
      <p>The Wild Force Rangers were featured in a chronicle of Power Ranger history compiled by Tommy Oliver shortly after he formed the Dino Rangers, which was found by the nascent Ranger team in the Dino Lab.</p>
      <h3>Megaforce</h3>
      <p>Alyssa along with the other Wild Force Rangers and other Ranger teams are seen in Troy's premonition about the Legendary Battle.</p>
      <p>She and the other Rangers are seen again in another of Troy's dream/vision about the Legendary Battle.</p>
      <h3>Super Megaforce</h3>
      <p>When the Mega Rangers receive the new Legendary Morphers, what makes the Mega Rangers access to Legendary Mode, Alyssa along with other Rangers are seen briefly in another vision/flashback, when Gosei talk about to the Mega Rangers to take the form of the past Rangers using the Legendary Ranger Keys. </p>
      <p>Emperor Mavro was defeated, but the remaining thousands of X Borgs still stand. Tommy gathered all the existing Power Rangers, Alyssa returned with her fellow Wild Force Rangers as part of the army of Legendary Rangers led by Tommy that helped the Mega Rangers defeat the Armada once and for all, fighting in a huge battle against hundreds of X Borgs and dozens of Bruisers. After the demise of the X Borgs, Tommy shook hands with Troy and teleported off along with Alyssa and the Legendary Rangers.</p>
      <h3>Dino Fury</h3>
      <p>Zayto brings up how different Ranger teams had motorcycles for transportation, showing Aiyon and Solon the Mighty Morphin Rangers' Shark Cycles and the Wild Force Rangers' Savage Cycles. Solon does not see the need for a motorcycle as the Dino Fury Rangers can already teleport. </p>
      <p>Zayto activates the Legendary Ranger Database, showing Master Blue that Master Green came to them after the Dinohenge statues were destroyed and restored them to normal. Also, Zayto says that he found Ranger teams who were saved in their darkest moments through unexplained reasons and shows them three specific moments. Including the Legendary Battle where all the Legendary Rangers including Alyssa and the other Wild Force Rangers coming to the aid of the Megaforce Rangers in the Legendary Battle and helping them defeat an entire army of the Armada's X Borgs.</p>
