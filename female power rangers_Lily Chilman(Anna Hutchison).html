      <p>Lily "Lil" Chilman is the Jungle Fury Yellow Ranger of the Jungle Fury Rangers.</p>
      <p>She is retroactively referred to as Yellow Jungle Fury Ranger - a variation of her in-show label. Like Casey she is 18 years old. She is one of the guardians.</p>
      <h3>Jungle Fury</h3>
      <p> Lily was a student of the Pai Zhuq academy. Along with her friend Theo Martin, she was chosen to be one of the guardians for Dai Shi. She was present when Dai Shi was accidentally released by Jarrod. Travelling with Theo and the new Pai Zhuq student Casey Rhodes, she became the Jungle Fury Yellow Ranger, under the mentorship of RJ. </p>
      <p> Lily passes her master test and gets a Pai Zhuq Master Tattoo.</p>
      <p> In Way of the Master, Master Phant returned and Lily trained in the way of the Elephant and gaining the Jungle Mace.</p>
      <p> She is the nicest of the five Jungle Fury Rangers. In the episode Bad to the Bone, she became rude due to a quill attack from Porcupongo. She ends up refusing to help the other Rangers during battle, until Fran removes the quill from her.</p>
