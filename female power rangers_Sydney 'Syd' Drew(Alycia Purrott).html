      <p>Sydney "Syd" Drew is an S.P.D. Cadet who began her Ranger activities as the S.P.D. Pink Ranger. She is a member of the B-Squad Rangers of the S.P.D. Rangers.</p>
      <h3>Dino Thunder</h3>
      <p> When Kira the Yellow Dino Ranger is the first who touched a glowing rock, she saw herself becoming a Ranger. However, she also had a vision of the new team of Power Rangers, the S.P.D. Rangers including Syd as the S.P.D. Pink Ranger. An evil space alien confronts the new team of Rangers. The S.P.D. Rangers summon a Mega Cannon called R.I.C. to take down the alien. Ethan is the second who touched a glowing rock, seen the vision of the S.P.D. Rangers call for the Delta Runners. The Delta Squad Megazord is formed to combat evil. Another alien species threatens the existence of Earth. </p>
      <h3>S.P.D.</h3>
      <p>Sydney came from a rich family and although being spoiled shows, she was the heart of the team. She took pride in her looks and accomplishments as a model, singer, and fencer; but her appearance could fool anyone, as she could hold her own as the S.P.D. Pink Ranger. Syd started off shallow and was quick to think about herself and her appearance. When Z first moved into her room, she was not happy at all. She is one of the three original S.P.D. B-Squad Rangers, along with Sky and Bridge.</p>
      <p>On her birthday, all she cared about was herself; Jack Landors, the Red Ranger, saw this and forced her to do a scouting job on her birthday. She was very angry at this until she realized Jack didn't even have a birthday. She later held a party for both herself and Jack and allowed him to share her birthday along with hers.</p>

      <p>Sydney, or "Syd" as she was later nicknamed, was the daughter of one of the five scientists exposed to unusual radiation which changed all of them. Her unusual ability was "Fist of Iron" (she carried a pocket-size iron nugget in her uniform belt), but her true ability was altering her molecular structure, transforming it into whatever element she touches.</p>
      <p>As time went on, Sydney learned the value of friendship and was always there for her team. When R.I.C. was ready for the scrap heap, she defended his worth and recruited Bridge and Boom to repair and upgrade him. She came through during S.W.A.T. training on Zantor and against A-Squad. By the end, she taught all of her teammates how to be better Rangers, just as much as they did to her.</p>
      <h3>Mission Training</h3>
      <p>She is shown on the screen of the viewers registered database, Syd in the archive footage as the S.P.D. Pink Ranger is seen during the morphing sequence with her S.P.D. Rangers, while Rex Ranger is learning to Matt and Trevor the movements for to realize the S.P.D. Rangers morphing sequence. </p>
      <h3>Megaforce</h3>

      <p>She and the other Rangers are seen again in another of Troy's dream/vision about the Legendary Battle.</p>
      <h3>Super Megaforce</h3>
      <p>Emperor Mavro was defeated, but the remaining thousands of X Borgs still stand. Tommy gathered all the existing Power Rangers, Syd returns with her fellow S.P.D. Rangers as part of the army of Legendary Rangers that helped the Mega Rangers defeat the Armada once and for all, fighting in a huge battle against hundreds of X Borgs and dozens of Bruisers. After the demise of the X Borgs, Tommy shook hands with Troy and teleported off along with Syd and the Legendary Rangers. She then returns to the future in the year 2034.</p>
      <h3>Dino Fury</h3>
      <p>Zayto activates the Legendary Ranger Database, showing Master Blue that Master Green came to them after the Dinohenge statues were destroyed and restored them to normal.
