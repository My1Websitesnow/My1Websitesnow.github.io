      <p>Zoey Reeves is the Yellow Ranger of the Grid Battleforce Rangers.</p>
      <h3>Beast Morphers</h3>
      <strong>Becoming a Ranger</strong>
      <p>Zoey Reeves is a former Grid Battleforce cadet who was cut from the program and later re-assigned to laundry service. When Evox attacked Grid Battleforce to take over the Morphin Grid, she found herself running towards danger as everyone else evacuated. She comes face to face with evil avatars of the would-be Rangers and fights them off. System creator Nate Silva forced the Yellow Ranger morph on her to give her a fighting chance. </p>
      <p> Zoey met her Beast Bot Jax and called him "cute" much to his embarrassment. Upon meeting the Beast Bots, Zoey, Devon and Ravi saw the Zords that they can use while the Beast Bots act as the control drivers. Zoey states that she also has experience reorganizing laundry department. Zoey and Ravi began to argue about becoming the leader, but they're stopped by Devon. When Ravi goes on a rampage, he targets Zoey causing her to lose energy and get sent to Grid Battleforce for the weakness therapy. Zoey eats a carrot so she can regenerate her energy. Devon is frozen, Zoey and Jax drives the Chopper Zord and attacks Cycledrone in order to unfreeze Devon.</p>
      <p> Nate shows the tutorial for the Beast-X Cannon for Zoey so she can use it for her combat, and a X-Bike for her to ride as well. In the forest, she rode her bike and saw Mayor Daniels who planned to cut through the forest by constructing a new road. Zoey arrives and rushes in front of a bulldozer to save a lizard, which startles the reporter, who reveals herself to be Zoey’s mother. Zoey decides to make a plea to protect the forest ecosystem to the Mayor. After giving her plea, Zoey presents to the Mayor her X-Bike, which runs on clean and renewable Morph-X. The Mayor task Zoey that she has one week to get people to ride her bikes in order for the Mayor to cancel his plans for the road. Zoey agrees and her mom expresses her pleasure to Zoey that she has a story to cover and that she will be making big money for Grid Battleforce.</p>
      <p>The Rangers soon found the avatar of Blaze and chased him all the way to the warehouse until Roxy stops them. Blaze retreats with Tronics and Morph-X so he can take it to Scrozzle, while Roxy began to deal with the Rangers. With Needledrone attacking the city, Ravi left the warehouse and deploy the Wheeler Zord, followed by Devon and his Racer Zord, in order to rescue him and destroy the Gigadrone, leaving Zoey alone to fight Roxy. After Zoey concludes that she and Roxy are both tough, Roxy teleports away and Zoey tells Jax that she needs a carrot after her energy drains out. The next day at the forest, Zoey comes and asks her mom where Mayor Daniels is at so that she can show the Mayor her new bike designs. After Mayor Daniels departs on his bike, Zoey thanks her mom for the viral video. Not wanting the credit, Zoey's mom tells her that the Rangers are the ones that made her bikes look fantastic. </p>

      <p><strong>Evox Upgraded</strong></p>
      <p>Following the arrival of Vargoyle, a new robotic member of Evox's army, the Rangers confronted the villain while a dropped camera recorded them. The video, which included footage of them morphing, reached Zoey's mother, who planned to reveal the Rangers' secret identities to the world after her camera technician fixed the corrupted data. Thankfully, Zoey managed to convince her mother not to reveal their identities after an interview with the celebrity Nikki Rev. </p>
      <p>Vargoyle soon uses a Memory Pulsator on the broadcast tower, freezing everybody and erasing their memories of Evox’s previous attacks and make Grid Battleforce believe that Blaze and Roxy became Power Rangers alongside Ravi instead of becoming Avatars. This resulted in Zoey believing that she was still working at the laundry department. After Devon and Steel destroy the Memory Pulsator, Zoey regains her memories. </p>
      <p>When Devon was taken to the Cyber Dimension along with the Morph-X Tower of Grid Battleforce, Zoey, the Rangers and Mayor Daniels use the Cybergate to enter the Cyber Dimension and rescue Devon. After rescuing their leader, Zoey had an idea which involved destroying the Morph-X Tower that was stolen in the Cyber Dimension to stop Evox from going to Coral Harbor. The plan was a success as the Rangers escaped the Cyber Dimension and seemingly destroyed Evox, preventing him from reaching their world. Zoey and her fellow Rangers later receive a medal of honor from Grid Battleforce and Mayor Daniels.</p>
      <p><strong>Return of Evox</strong></p>
      <p>Months after the battle at the Cyber Dimension, Zoey continued to train and operate as a Ranger. She also worked with Nate on the creation of a new weapon, the Beast-X Ultra Blaster. When Steel told the team that he believed that Evox survived his defeat and was coming back, the team didn't believe him, but they soon realized that he was right after witnessing Scrozzle gathering Morph-X along with a squad of Tronics.</p>
      <p>After Steel realized that Zoey and Nate had feelings for each other, Zoey makes him promise not to tell anyone due to the Grid Battleforce rule that forbids relationships between Rangers. Steel later volunteered her and Nate as bodyguards to Mayor Daniels so they could spend some time together. Commander Shaw eventually found out about their relationship but soon realized that their feelings only made their teamwork better as shown during a fight against Blaze and Roxy, so she decided to remove the rule. This happiness did not last however, as the Rangers realized that Evox survived inside Mayor Daniels' body and escaped Grid Battleforce.</p>
      <p>The Mayor was eventually saved after they tricked Evox into standing in blank range of the Split Emitters that were teleported from Grid Battleforce, successfully separating Evox from Mayor Daniels.</p>

      <p><strong>Grid Connection</strong></p>
      <p>When the Rangers are sent to retrieve the villain relics from Ryjack’s Ship, Zoey encounters a suspicious figure whom she puts under the influence of a Compliance Collar before realizing that said figure was Keeper, the mentor of the Dino Charge Rangers. Following Keeper's capture by Blaze and Roxy, Zoey and her team are met with the arrival of the Dino Charge Rangers who arrived from their dimension to find Keeper. </p>
      <p>The two team of Rangers went to an abandoned warehouse to trade Ryjack's collection for Keeper, but when Snide didn't follow up on the agreement both teams morphed and got ready to fight, Zoey and her team went to take care of a Gigadrome attack while the Dino Charge Rangers fought Snide, but they returned to rescue the team when Sledge and his crew arrived. The two teams rescued Keeper and the Dino Charge Rangers departed to their home universe after forgiving Zoey for her mistake. </p>
      <p>After the Rangers caught most of Sledge's crew trying to steal diamonds to help Evox with his Reanimizer in order to resurrect other villains, Zoey fought against Curio and Poisandra before her team used their Beast-X Cannons to destroy the crew. </p>
      <p>Days later, Grid Battleforce received a message from Tyler, saying that Goldar and Snide were attacking his team while trying to get their Energems. With Devon at a video game tournament, Zoey and the three remaining Rangers travel to the Dino Charge universe via a trans-dimensional portal that Tyler opened mid-battle to fight Goldar and his army. The team was unsuccessful and couldn't stop the villains from getting most of the Dino Charge Rangers' Energems, but they are soon met with the arrival of Devon and Jason, the original Red Ranger.</p>
      <p>While Jason took the Dino Charge Rangers into a frontal attack, Zoey and her team went around the back to stop Scrozzle, who began creating a new Dinozord for Evox with the Energems. The Rangers were then blasted by Evox, who left Robo-Blaze to finish them off while he used his new Zord to attack the Dino Ranger team, but Blaze was quickly destroyed by the Beast-X King Ultra Bow. While Zoey and the other Rangers were injured, Devon summoned the Beast-X King Zord and joined the Megazord fight against Evox's Chimera Zord. Forming the Dino Charge Megazord Beast-X King Formation, the three Megazords combined their blasts to destroy the Chimera Zord as Evox retreated. Despite the fight being over, Jason remarked that Evox was not done yet before leaving, but Zoey confidently said that they could handle him before thanking everybody for their help.</p>
      <p><strong>Defeating Evox</strong></p>
      <p>A year later, Zoey creates industrial fans that uses Morph-X to conduct power, later she and Nate were called into the launch hangar for a surprise birthday party for Steel. </p>
      <h3>Dino Fury</h3>
      <p><strong>Appearance in visions</strong></p>
      <p>When the Rafkonian Ranger Zayto from the Dino Fury Rangers read the Ninja Nexus Prism's mind he saw visions of multiples Rangers from the past, including one of Zoey and the other Grid Battleforce Rangers seen during Steel's "death". </p>
      <p>Zoey is briefly seen in a flashback via the Legendary Ranger Database alongside Devon, Ravi, Steel and Nate whilst Ollie and Solon discover that the Compliance Collar used on Lord Zedd by Reaghoul has been used before.</p>
      <p><strong>Containing a Prison Break</strong></p>
      <p>After a huge jailbreak at one of the Grid Battleforce facility was created by Lord Zedd, Zoey and her team tried to contain some of the escaped prisoners while General Shaw contacted the Dino Fury Rangers to warn them about one of the prisoners, Lothorn heading to Pine Ridge. While the Grid Battleforce Rangers managed to contain the prison break, their old foe Scrozzle managed to escape their grasp. </p>
      <p>When Zayto uses the Legendary Ranger Database to show Master Blue the times Master Green helped various Ranger teams, Zoey and her team were seen during Steel's death and subsequent resurrection.</p>

Zoey can manually transform into the Yellow Ranger with using her Beast-X Morpher and Morph-X Key, however for her to be able to transform she must be bonded with the Jackrabbit DNA in order to morph into the Yellow Ranger.</p>
