      <p>Lt. Taylor Earhardt is the Yellow Eagle Wild Force Ranger, the Yellow Ranger of the Wild Force Power Rangers. Before Cole's arrival, she was the team leader, making her the first Yellow Ranger to do so. She is also the second-in-command to Cole Evans.</p>
      <h3>Wild Force</h3>
      <p>As a young child, Taylor looked out of an airplane window and saw the Animarium. Little did she know that one day she would be one of its champions. Taylor always had a fascination with planes and flying in general. This interest led her to become a skilled fighter pilot for the Air Force, earning the rank of Lieutenant. While flying around with her squad one day, Taylor witnessed a magnificent sight - the Yellow Eagle Wildzord, soaring in the sky beside her. She followed the Eagle to the Animarium, where she crash landed. She eventually found Princess Shayla and the temple and was asked to become the Yellow Ranger.</p>
      <p>Her military training and past had made Taylor rather a bit cold, unfeeling regimental, tomboyish and insensitive, but a rigid leader at times. She takes command of situations and focuses on the task at hand. In battle, she often takes charge and engages the Orgs first, capable of even fighting the Orgs alone in battle when the others are not available.</p>
      <p>Taylor has an intense rivalry with Duke Org Jindrax and they often engage in battle immediately upon eye contact (much like Alyssa Enril√© &#38; Toxica), exchanging jests and insults in between, even in the presence of other Orgs. Like Taylor, Jindrax uses a sword and darts in battle and their battles are often fierce with both exchanging heavy blows to one another (Taylor in particular takes so much damage to the point that her Ranger suit is in shreds after her battles with Jindrax). It is implied that they have had a long history of battling, stemming back to over a year when Taylor was the first and only Ranger on the team. Early on in the series, Taylor had trouble dealing with Jindrax's swordsmanship and quick reflexes, losing several battles to Jindrax often in frustration. Over time, Taylor successfully improves her durability and agility, overcoming her struggles against Jindrax's swordmanship, dealing more damage to the Duke Org and winning easily by the end of the series. She did not have an opportunity to battle with Super Jindrax, due to being gravely injured by Super Nayzor and being trapped in limbo. </p>

      <p>As the leader of Wild Force before Cole Evans for well over a year, Taylor wrote a Ranger rulebook that the entire team was required to abide by which Cole immediately dismissed upon joining the team shortly after, simply stating that the only "rule" that the team needed was teamwork. Taylor resented Cole as she was now relegated as the second-in-command, losing authority within the team, and stormed out of Animarium in a fit of rage due to Cole's lack of respect for her morals. She is later turned invisible by Camera Org after choosing to engage in battle alone without contacting the team, getting ambushed and quickly defeated by Duke Org Jindrax in "Click, Click, Zoom", unable to land even a single hit on either Jindrax or Camera Org and ending up in a life-threatening situation. Feeling guilty for putting her in the predicament to begin with and realizing the significance of Taylor's rulebook, Cole vowed to saves her life and gets her body back, as well as saving the other victims of Camera Org's deeds. Cole manages to free Taylor and the other victims after destroying Camera Org's Film Cartridges (in which Taylor realized at that moment why Shayla felt confident in Cole leading the team) where she later joins the battle and makes peace with Cole even snidely noting that Cole had to deal with Camera Org alone and therefore breaking his own rule of embracing 'teamwork'. </p>
      <p>The episode The Bear Necessities shows her past life as a pilot and she gets two new Wild Zords.</p>
      <p>She faces her old rival Motorcycle Org and looses her Bear Zords to Zen-Aku in the episode "Revenge of Zen-Aku".</p>
      <p>When she teamed up with the Time Force Rangers to defeat the Mut-Orgs, Taylor quickly developed a love/hate relationship with the equally dominant and commanding Eric Myers, the Quantum Ranger, because they had a little accident with traffic. The two abrasive Rangers started out consistently clashing with one another, though they eventually gained something of a mutual respect. Eric even lent her the Quantum Defender in battle, something he'd only let Wes Collins wield before. </p>
      <p>After the final battle with Master Org, Taylor gave up her Ranger powers and returned to the Air Force, where she was looked up to as a legend by the younger members. She frequently meets her friend the Yellow Eagle in the sky.</p>
      <h3>Dino Thunder</h3>
      <p>The Wild Force Rangers were featured in a chronicle of Power Ranger history compiled by Tommy Oliver shortly after he formed the Dino Rangers, which was found by the nascent Ranger team in the Dino Lab.</p>
      <h3>Megaforce</h3>
      <p> Taylor along with the other Wild Force Rangers and other Ranger teams are seen in Troy's premonition about the Legendary Battle.</p>
      <div class="flex-container image-container"> <img src="female power rangers_Taylor Earhardt(Alyson Kiperman)/taylor earhard1.jpg" alt="Taylor earhard intro"> </div>
      <p>She and the other Rangers are seen again in another of Troy's dream/vision about the Legendary Battle.</p>
      <h3>Super Megaforce</h3>
      <p> When the Mega Rangers receive the new Legendary Morphers, what makes the Mega Rangers access to Legendary Mode, Taylor along with other Rangers are seen briefly in another vision/flashback, when Gosei talk about to the Mega Rangers to take the form of the past Rangers using the Legendary Ranger Keys. </p>
      <p> Emperor Mavro was defeated, but the remaining thousands of X Borgs still stand. Tommy gathered all the existing Power Rangers, Taylor returned with her fellow Wild Force Rangers as part of the army of Legendary Rangers led by Tommy that helped the Mega Rangers defeat the Armada once and for all, fighting in a huge battle against hundreds of X Borgs and dozens of Bruisers. After the demise of the X Borgs, Tommy shook hands with Troy and teleported off along with Taylor and the Legendary Rangers. </p>
      <h3>Dino Fury</h3>
      <p>Zayto brings up how different Ranger teams had motorcycles for transportation, showing Aiyon and Solon the Mighty Morphin Rangers' Shark Cycles and the Wild Force Rangers' Savage Cycles. Solon does not see the need for a motorcycle as the Dino Fury Rangers can already teleport.</p>
      <p>Zayto activates the Legendary Ranger Database, showing Master Blue that Master Green came to them after the Dinohenge statues were destroyed and restored them to normal. Also, Zayto says that he found Ranger teams who were saved in their darkest moments through unexplained reasons and shows them three specific moments. Including the Legendary Battle where all the Legendary Rangers including Taylor and the other Wild Force Rangers coming to the aid of the Megaforce Rangers in the Legendary Battle and helping them defeat an entire army of the Armada's X Borgs.</p>
