      <p>Kendall Morgan is the proprietor and lead scientist of the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum. After Albert retires and gives the Purple Energem to the Dino Charge Rangers, she later acquires it and becomes the new Dino Charge Purple Ranger.</p>
      <p> Based on previously released toys and roll calls, she can also be referred to as the Plesiosaurus Power Ranger Purple. </p>
      <h3>Dino Charge</h3>
      <p>Not much is known about Kendall's past except that at some point she came across Keeper and the two collaborated to track down the Energems.</p>
      <p>Kendall became in charge of the thriving Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum and frequently accompanied by her assistants Chase Randall and Koda for paleontology digs. She is also frequently pestered by waitress Shelby Watkins for dig-related work.</p>
      <p>After the formation of the Ranger team, Kendall later developed auxiliary Dino Chargers for the Rangers to use to defeat Sledge's monsters and, with Shelby's help, she invented the E-Tracer. While she rarely engaged in battle, Kendall proved able to hold her own if need be.</p>
      <h3>Becoming a Ranger</h3>
      <p>After Albert surrenders the Purple Energem, the Rangers go to great lengths to find someone for it to bond with but have nothing to show for it. Desperate, Kendall falls for a plot by one of Sledge's monsters that leads to the Energem being stolen. To correct this mistake, Kendall creates Get-Bot, a robot designed to seek out and recover Energems. She has the Rangers distract Sledge while she stows Get-Bot in a transport pod but decides to stow away herself when Keeper is captured. On the ship, Kendall manages to find the Purple Energem only to be captured and imprisoned in the same room as Keeper. Using nearby acid, Kendall corrodes the cell's floor, allowing the two to jump down to the corridor beneath. Cornered by two Spikeballs, Kendall attempts to fight them off, causing the Purple Energem to bond with her and instantly morph her into the new Purple Ranger. </p>
      <p> Kendall rescues Keeper with the arrival of Shelby and Tyler, and the four escape Sledge's ship with the Plesio Charge Megazord and help defeat Sledge's ultimate monster. </p>
      <h3>Street Fighter Showdown</h3>
      <p> When Rita Repulsa join forces with Mr. Bison, as a result they infected the Morphin Grid, Kendall is one of the many Rangers who are infected, later as Dino Charge Purple Ranger is summoned among various evil Rangers by M. Bison's side. She along with the other Evil Rangers, going to fight lead by Mr. Bison against Mighty Morphin Green Ranger V2, Super Megaforce Yellow Ranger, Ryu Ranger and Chun-Li.</p>
      <h3>Beast Morphers</h3>
      <p>In the Grid Battleforce base, when Devon Daniels ask for help from Doctor K to try to search a form of device to separate Mayor Daniels from Evox, she reveals one. A few years ago, Doctor K read about how the Dino Charge Rangers including Kendall were able to rescue Zenowing from being inside Doomwing thanks to the Split Emitters and that peaks Devonâ€™s interest. </p>
