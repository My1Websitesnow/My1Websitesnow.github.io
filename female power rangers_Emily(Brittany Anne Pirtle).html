      <p>Emily is Samurai Ranger Earth, the Yellow Samurai Ranger of the Samurai Rangers. She is innocent, sweet and the youngest of the Rangers. As Yellow Ranger, she pilots the Ape FoldingZord and controls the element of Earth.</p>
      <p>Emily is a sweet, innocent country girl who was never supposed to be the Yellow Samurai Power Ranger. It was her older sister, Serena, who was destined for the squad, but an illness forced Emily to take her place. Although she is a bit of a fish out of water, the passion of the team and the bustle of the city inspires Emily to train hard and make her sister proud.</p>
      <h3>Samurai</h3>
      <p> In "Sticks and Stones", it was revealed that, as a young girl, Emily was said to be a crybaby and was often picked on by her peers. When her sister, who was originally going to be the Yellow Ranger, got ill, Emily was chosen as the Yellow Ranger, and promised not to cry ever again. This helped her teach her teammates how to not be affected by Negatron. </p>
      <p>She joins the team in "Origins", and her best friend ends up being Mia, the Pink Samurai Ranger.</p>
      <p>It's often seen she may have a crush on Mike, the Green Samurai Ranger. Near the end of "Clash of the Red Rangers", Scott, Ranger Operator Series Red, told Mike that he "sees the way Emily looks at Mike".</p>
      <h3>Super Samurai</h3>
      <p>She later on helps Mike fight a Nighlok, when the other Rangers are swapped with inanimate objects, when the Nighlok grew, Mike used the Black Box and summoned the Claw Armor Megazord. They agree to "never fight another Nighlok together alone again".</p>
      <p>Her greatest time to shine came when a Nighlok caused extreme hunger and thirst in all the Rangers, save for her. She battled the Nighlok one-on-one, proving she's tough, and a strong fighter, even without the others. During this battle, she used the Black Box for the first time.</p>

      <p>In "Samurai Forever", after defeating Master Xandred along with her team, Emily goes home to take care of Serena at home. Mike goes with Emily to "help her move things." But it is unknown if they started dating since they hold hands at the end.</p>
      <h3>Megaforce</h3>
