      <p>Princess Shayla is the beautiful Princess of the Animarium, a floating landmass that is the last remnant of the lost world of Animaria. She is also the mentor to the Wild Force Power Rangers.</p>
      <p>After the defeats of Animus and Master Org, Shayla fell asleep for centuries. 3,000 years later, she was reawakened along; with the Org spirits by the pollution caused by humans. Shayla serves as the adviser to the Rangers, sometimes fills in a "damsel in distress" role, but she can and will defend herself if absolutely necessary.</p>

      <p>Shayla is kind and very accepting, notably showing kindness to the evil Zen-Aku when he appeared to be in pain, despite him having kidnapped her and being a powerful enemy (though he was later proven to be Merrick Baliton under a curse), also when the Duke Org Jindrax was being hunted down by his fellow Orgs she tried to comfort him despite her being his captive and even trying to reason with Master Org while being imprisoned by him in the Nexus, but she has a strong will. She has romantic feelings for and an on-and-off relationship with Merrick, the Lunar Wolf Ranger - her former protector from 3,000 years ago; due to the fact that; he refuses to let his reciprocated feelings for her show because of his guilt over what happened during the original Master Org's demise and what he feels is his duty, and he's the one who gave her golden necklace which enables her to communicate with the Rangers, to see images in its jewel and to even empower the Wild Zords, and she wore it until it was stolen by Master Org to use it in his final ceremony to empower himself.</p>
      <p>After the Master Org of the present-day was destroyed, Shayla took back the Wild Force Ranger Powers and raised the Animarium back; into the sky; until they and the Wildzords were needed to protect the Earth once more.</p>
      <p>According to Alyssa's narration; Shayla returned to her sleep after departing from the Rangers and was presumably, still in her slumber; when the Animarium was visited by the HyperForce Rangers and the Megaforce Rangers.</p>
